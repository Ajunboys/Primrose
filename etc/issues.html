    <h1>Issues with lighting upgrading from Three.JS r72 to r74</h1>
    <p>My PC is running Windows 8.1 with an NVidia GTX 980.</p>
    <p>This is <a href="http://www.primrosevr.com/examples/editor3d/index.html">the demo</a> in question.</p>
    <h2>Chrome 48 Stable, Three.JS r72</h2>
    <p>This is the expected image. The sky, ground, and blue cubes all have textures loaded from an image file. The text elements have textures built from HTML canvases.</p>

    <h2>Chrome 48 Stable, Three.JS r74</h2>

    <p>This is the image after the upgrade. Notice the lighting is much "shinier". On the right edge you can see it's also the case for the further-away items.</p>

    <h2>Chromium WebVR v1/Oculus, ThreeJS r72</h2>
    <p>There is an additional problem that I'm trying to work out, where Chromium 51 won't load my textures.</p>

    <h2>Chromium WebVR v1/Oculus, ThreeJS r74</h2>
    <p>Yet somehow, r74 gets that the sky should be brighter than the ground. Very odd. Texture coordinates not set correctly?</p>
