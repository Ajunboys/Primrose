# Head Mounted Displays

To get the most out of Primrose, you will want to use a Head Mounted Display (HMD)
of some kind. There are several options available&mdash;some inexpensive, some very powerful.

## Smartphone-based Stereo Viewers

Most modern smartphone devices come with features that make them suitable as stereo
image viewers.
* High resolution displays,
* Multi-core main processors,
* Graphics processors,
* Orientation and acceleration sensing hardware,
* Bluetooth and/or USB-host connectivity for peripheral devices.

With the addition of a couple of lenses, a frame in which to hold the lenses and
phone, and the right software, the smartphone you already own may be convertible
into a basic stereo image viewer, suitable for short-term, limited VR use.
